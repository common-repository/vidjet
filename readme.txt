= WHY SHORT & SHOPPABLE VIDEOS? =
Have videos on social media? Want to offer your customers a new shopping experience to generate extra sales? With Vidjet you can import videos from various sources, pick pre-build formats, and publish them at scale on webpages.

**Improve conversion rates**
Tag products on videos, give discounts to your customers, collect emails, and use formats (ex: carousel, stories, floating bubble) that best fit your pages.

**Increase engagement on your website**
Create engaging video feeds to delight your visitors, throughout their journey. It will result in an increase of time spent on pages (up to 3X), and a decrease of bounce rate (up to 30%).

**Modernize your customer journey**
Offer your visitors a TikTok-like experience using our immersive swipe-up player. And, use segmentation criteria to trigger well-timed videos throughout your funnel.

**No impact on loading times, and mobile friendly**
Vidjet videos use an asynchronous loading logic that has a minimal impact on your SEO, your site score, and no impact on your loading times. Also, our player is made to be 100% responsive on any devices.
